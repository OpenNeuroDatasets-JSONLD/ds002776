### Motor sequence learning

This contains the raw 7 Tesla fMRI data and structural images, used in the "A critical re-evaluation of fMRI signatures of motor sequence learning" (<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.899229v2.full>). Please, note that while this is a preprint, the dataset should be cited using a published peer-reviewed version of the paper. 

The experiment consisted of 4 imaging sessions, across 5 weeks of training. Participants (N=26) underwent session 1 (ses-01) prior to training onset, session 2 (ses-02) after a week of training and sessions 3-4 (ses-03, ses-04) after 5 weeks. Performance across sesssions 1-3 was paced using a metronome, and in session 4 the performance was at full speed.

Participants executed inside the scanner 6 trained and 6 untrained sequences. Sequence identity (1-12) and sequence type (trained / untrained) for each trial can be found in the accompanying events.tsv files. Additionally, each sequence was performed twice in a row (repetition 1-2 in events.tsv).
